Finally he had arrived at his destination.
- Santa! I have a gift for you! said Hugo.

Hugo handed over the gift and Santa opened it with great anticipation.
- A cane! Just what i wanted, shouted Santa full of joy and christmas spirit.
From this tale of a young puppy we can learn that if we just listen to eachother
