Finally he had arrived at his destination.
- Santa! I have a gift for you! said Hugo.
- For an old man like me?
Hugo handed over the gift and Santa opened it with great anticipation.
- A cane! Just what i wanted, shouted Santa full of joy and christmas spirit.
- And Viggo gave santa a Massage as a christmas gift.
